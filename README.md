# MS2ship

## Introduction
MS2ship is a ship image dataset for maritime UAV-based object detection tasks. The ship images are primarily selected from two maritime datasets, i.e., Seagull and SeaDronesSee datasets. The video data of the Seagull dataset are carefully framed and filtered to obtain ship images. Most images selected from the SeaDronesSee dataset only retain ship objects. In order to enrich water scenes of the MS2ship dataset, we carefully picked 425 ship images from UAV123, DTB70, DAC-SDC, and other datasets. The MS2ship dataset ultimately consists of 6,470 images with a total of 13,697 boxes.
